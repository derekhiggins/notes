Small and simple note organising shell script

This script can be used to maintain a directory of notes for quick access,
there isn't much to it, but it can be handy

Installation :
    simply arrange so that the file "notes" can be found in your PATH

Usage :
    # Edit a note named "foobar"
    > note foobar

    # list all known notes
    > note

Bash completion :
    if you want to setup bash completion then you can do one of
    o source the contents of notes.completion in the file ~/.bashrc by adding
    this line
    . /path/to/notes.completion

    or

    o place the contents of notes.completion into the file ~/.bashrc

    or

    o place a copy of the file notes.completion in the global bash
    completion config directory, (probably the directory /etc/bash_completion.d/)

    once done (you will need to reload by opening a new terminal)
    hitting tab x 2, should bring up a list of possible notes e.g.
    > note f<tab><tab>
fedora_network  fedex_details


Config :
    the environment variable $NOTESDIR can be used to change the location
    to store the notes, it defaults to ~/.notes
